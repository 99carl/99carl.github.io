title: "What could slow down the global economic recovery in 2021?"

With varying degrees of success, countries across the world are already starting to vaccinate their populations. This is a pretty remarkable feat given that the pandemic first upended global economies less than a year ago. Thanks to this,  rosy forecasts for the economic recovery are in abundance. However, there are key hurdles that could sidetrack the recovery. In this post I take a look at some of them. 

Both the OECD and the IMF are optimistic about what's in store for 2021. As the vaccine rollout starts to gain momentum, it will reach a critical juncture this summer whereby, with the aid of fiscal support, economic activity should rebound and launch economies back to pre-pandemic levels by 2022. For instance, in October the IMF published its ["World Economic Outlook](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO). It predicts that the global economy will grow by 5.1% in 2021. The US economy is forecasted to grow by 3%, meanwhile the European by 5%. Emerging markets are propelled by India and China to have a forecast exceeding 8% growth. These forecasts are a welcome respite from the doom and gloom that dominated 2020. However, it would be wrong to ignore some clear risks to that recovery. 

To begin, it looks like **vaccine rollout will be slow**. The US is struggling to get up to speed, as are many European countries. France, for instance, has been wrangling with anti-vaxer population. [Only 40% of the French population say they'll take the vaccine](https://www.lefigaro.fr/sciences/covid-19-la-france-championne-du-monde-des-refractaires-au-vaccin-20201229) compared to [77% of Brits](https://www.ipsos.com/en/global-attitudes-covid-19-vaccine-december-2020). The longer it takes for countries to reach a critical mass of vaccinations, the longer they push off economic recovery. 

Secondly, **damage to the labour market means re-employment could be slow**. Job losses due to the pandemic disproportionately affected workers that could not work remote. A lot of those jobs are low-skill jobs where the workers may struggle to find employment elsewhere.

Furthermore, **emerging markets face an uphill struggle** in the face of lower revenues from commodities and tourism, as well as decreased remittances. They have fewer monetary instruments at their disposal compared to advanced economies, and the ones they do have - including buying government debt and quantitative easing - are limited in scope. As advanced economies recover, this risks increasing the inequality between global economies.
