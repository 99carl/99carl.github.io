At the beginning of 2020 one of my New Years resolutions was to start writing a journal. I felt it would be nice to document my final year as an undergraduate. That, as with almost any New Years resolution, did not last. With the curse of hindsight, though, 2020 would be the most historic in my life. However, the issues that defined 2020 will not disappear just because we entered a new year. And so, with that, I've decided to start a blog. 

If anything, this is to document my thoughts and feelings on the state of world  developments. Beyond that, though, I want to use this as an opportunity to dive deep into issues or events that pique my interest. 

Will my views change? Probably. But for me the important part of this exercise is to try and understand issues and events that we will ultimately look back on in some way or another. 

So, with that, welcome. Feel free to [subscribe](/subscribe) or [follow me on twitter](www.twitter.com/csacklen).
