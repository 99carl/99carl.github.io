Much of the US, and indeed the world, breathed a sigh of relief when Joe Biden won the election. Worryingly though, roughly half of the electorate views him as illegitimate. That has consequences for how effectively the next President will be able to govern. 

Joe Biden won the election with 306 Electoral Votes and exceeded 80 million popular votes. But President Trump's rejection of the election result has no historic precedent and shines a light once again on the divided country Biden is set to inherit on January 20th. 

Trump's support goes beyond just the vocal and loyal following. He won 11 million more votes than he did in 2016 by capturing more Hispanic and Black voters. Furthermore, his refusal to concede is seen as legitimate and brave, not undemocratic and obstructive. These voters will influence the political narrative of the coming Presidential term because they decide which blocs wield power in Congress. 

These voters  This means Biden will face resistance in both the Upper and Lower houses from politicians elected by Trump-supporting Republicans. Thanks to gerrymandering, Trump voters are concentrated in districts, meaning a strong anti-Biden bloc will make their presence known in the House of Representatives. Similarly, many GOP Senators will feel no choice but to vote along party lines to avoid alienating their backers. All in all, this will make it difficult for Biden to govern and will make much-needed changes even more elusive. 

Markets rallied when the "blue wave" ground to a halt on Election Day. Right or wrong, a divided government is widely seen as good for businesses because it serves as an effective backstop to new regulation, reforms, and higher corporate tax rates. However, critical issues, including a  large stimulus package and healthcare reform, will have to be put on hold unless the Democrats pull off a win in Georgia's Senate run-offs. Similarly, reforms voiced by the progressive wing of the party, such as a higher minimum wage or a new voting rights act, will struggle to even get off the ground. 

This will leave Biden's supporters disappointed, and his critics aggravated. Supporters will point to shortcomings in fiscal stimulus packages or weak Covid-19 vaccine rollouts and blame a congress held hostage by a Trumpist coalition. If Biden is to get anything done in those conditions, he'll likely have to resort to ruling through executive order. This will play into the Trumpist narrative of feeling sidelined and ignored. Further polarisation and hostility can therefore be expected before it gets better. 

As a result, Biden, as "Healer-in-Chief", will need bipartisan victories - a strong vaccine rollout and robust economic recovery - if he wants to get senior Republicans on side. If he doesn't he risks handing over the keys to the Oval Office in four years time to another "America First" president.
