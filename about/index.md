Hi there! My name is Carl and I am a senior at the Univeristy of Chicago, where I am double majoring in Econonomics and Philosophy. Before that, I grew up in London in a Swedish family. I have a keen interest in geopolitics and geoeconomics and I started this blog to pursue that interest even further. Previous internships at Visa and American Express have also led me to grow a particular interest in global financial integration as well as financial inclusion and economic development. 

In my free time I am an avid runner and equally enthusiastic reader. In fact, you can see some books I've found helpful [here](/resources). You can also [follow me on twitter](www.twitter.com/csacklen).
