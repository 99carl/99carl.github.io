  Hi! My name is Carl Sacklen and I am a student at the University of Chicago studying Economics and Philosophy. Before that, I grew up in London and am a citizen of both Sweden and Britain.

  I made this website to publish side-projects on things that pique my interest. My main interests surround global economics and geopolitics. Internships at Visa and American Express have also made me particularly interested in economic develeopment and financial inclusion. 

  Thanks for checking in. You can also [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/csacklen)
