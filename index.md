  Hi! My name is Carl Sacklen and I am a student at the University of Chicago studying Economics and Philosophy. Before that, I grew up in London and am a citizen of both Sweden and Britain.

  I made this website to publish [side-projects](/projects) on things that pique my interest. You can also [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/csacklen)
