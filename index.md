Hi! My name is Carl and I am a student at the University of Chicago studying Economics and Philosophy. Before that, I grew up in London and am a citizen of both Sweden and Britain.

My interest surround global economics and geopolitics. Internships at Visa and American Express have also led me to grow an interest in economic development and financial inclusion.

I made this website to publish some [side-projects](/projects/) on things that pique my interest and I work on in my free time. You can also [follow me on Twitter](http//:twitter.com/csacklen).
